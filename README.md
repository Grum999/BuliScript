# Buli Script

A plugin for [Krita](https://krita.org).


## What is Buli Script?
*Buli Script* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).


Like [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) programming language, *Buli Script* is a scripting language that can be used to draw thing programmatically.

But it differs from (Logo)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)]:
- *Buli Script* provides a larger set of instructions, including some command that allows to drive [Krita](https://krita.org)
- *Buli Script* language wants to be easier to use than (Logo)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)]
